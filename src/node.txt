Use 8 layer network
Use graphs with 10K nodes
Use <= 200 beacons, start with 50
Pick 10K node pairs, train until error basically stable
Out of the 10K training pairs, pick 1K pairs with the highest errors
Compute quality of each potential beacon using equation
Pick top 5 beacons to add to set of beacons
Retrain network

Check the generalzation error.  If too high, then decrease number of network layers.


Sources of error in previous version
1.  Network too small / shallow (this might be true)
2.  Bad beacon selection (I think this is most likely)
3.  Poor network training
